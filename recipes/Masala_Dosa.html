    <h3>About this dish</h3>
    <p>Masala Dosa is readily available on street hawkers' carts anywhere in south India. But that is just Masala Dosa, not Mysore Masala Dosa. 
    And they use the same Batter for all the Dosas. Also, for the Masala Dosa, they just put some Potato Curry in the centre and roast it well.</p>
